As a developer who’s built AI agents for platforms like phone, SMS, and messaging apps, I've often faced the challenge of managing and versioning prompts. Every platform and use case demands its own tailored prompt, and before long, keeping track of all these variations can feel overwhelming.

## The Genesis of Promptix

My journey began with a personal challenge. While integrating an AI agent into a complex existing system, I quickly discovered that a single, static prompt just wouldn’t do. As the application grew, so did the number of prompts—each one vital to ensuring the best possible experience. I searched for a tool that was both easy to integrate and effective, but nothing out there met my needs. This gap inspired me to create  **Promptix**([https://github.com/Nisarg38/promptix-python](https://github.com/Nisarg38/promptix-python)):: a local-first library designed to simplify prompt management and versioning.

## What Makes Promptix Special

- **Local-First Design:** Promptix runs entirely on your local machine. This means your data stays private and you have full control over your prompt information.
- **Dynamic Templating:** Thanks to Jinja2 templating, you can create flexible prompts with dynamic variables. This allows you to adapt prompts to various contexts without repetitive work.
- **Version Control:** Manage different versions of your prompts with ease, making it simple to experiment and iterate as your project evolves.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** With a Streamlit-based UI, Promptix is designed for everyone—from seasoned developers to newcomers—making it a breeze to create, edit, and manage your prompts.

## Why Choose Promptix?

Other tools like PromptHub or PromptKnit have their merits, but they often rely on cloud environments or fall short in version control. Promptix is different. It keeps everything local, which is crucial for projects where data privacy is a top priority. With its combination of dynamic templating, robust version control, and an intuitive interface, Promptix is built to address the multifaceted needs of developers and teams alike.

## Getting Started with Promptix

- **Installation:** Clone the Promptix repository and install the required dependencies.
- **Using the UI:** Launch the Streamlit-based UI to interact with your prompts in a visual, hands-on way.
- **Direct YAML Editing:** If you’re more comfortable with manual configurations, simply edit the `prompts.yaml` file to set up your prompts.

## A Bit About My Journey

I recently graduated and have been diving headfirst into the world of service agents and AI. As an AI enthusiast, I poured my passion into creating Promptix, which also happens to be my very first library. This project not only helped solve a real-world challenge I was facing but also marks the beginning of my journey in building innovative tools for the AI community.
